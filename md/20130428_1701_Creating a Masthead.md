I have often thought during the time I've owned this domain that the
lead image should really reflect the obvious image potential.   So after shooting a 
portrait, I decided to break out the mixed leaf salad and create 
one.  Now one of the things that that children ask, is a lot of
questions, usually degenerating into the simple question 
"Why".  I guess it wouldn't surprise you that this
question popped up whilst I had a bowl of mixed salad carefully
moistened with a spray under the studio lights.

After getting the shot I wanted, my daughter eager to also have
a go, was let loose with the leaves to attempts a shot of her own.
